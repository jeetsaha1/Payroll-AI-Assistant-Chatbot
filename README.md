# 💬 AI Payroll Assistant with Chatbot


---

## 🧠 Abstract
The **AI Payroll Assistant with Chatbot** is an intelligent, automated system that merges **payroll management** with **conversational AI** to simplify employee salary processing and HR communication.  
Unlike traditional payroll systems that depend on manual data entry, this project uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to automate payroll calculations, handle employee queries, and offer real-time assistance through an interactive chatbot.

By integrating **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**, it transforms payroll into a **smart, interactive, and self-service experience** — ensuring accuracy, transparency, and convenience for both employees and HR administrators.

## 📘 1. Introduction
Payroll management is a crucial but repetitive HR function involving salary calculation, deductions, tax management, and payslip generation. Traditional systems often lack real-time communication and automation.

The **AI Payroll Assistant** addresses these limitations through:
- Automated salary computation.  
- Real-time conversational support.  
- Instant payslip generation.

Employees can simply ask questions like:
> “What is my current month’s salary?”  
> “Show my tax deductions.”  
> “When will my next payment be processed?”

The chatbot intelligently interprets and responds using the payroll database — enabling **faster, more transparent, and efficient** payroll management.
